 * SECTION:gstpbutilsinstallplugins
 * @title: Install-plugins
 * @short_description: Missing plugin installation support for applications
 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * Using this API, applications can request the installation of missing
 * GStreamer plugins. These may be missing decoders/demuxers or
 * encoders/muxers for a certain format, sources or sinks for a certain URI
 * protocol (e.g. 'http'), or certain elements known by their element
 * factory name ('audioresample').
 *
 * Whether plugin installation is supported or not depends on the operating
 * system and/or distribution in question. The vendor of the operating
 * system needs to make sure the necessary hooks and mechanisms are in
 * place for plugin installation to work. See below for more detailed
 * information.
 *
 * From the application perspective, plugin installation is usually
 * triggered either
 *
 * -   when the application itself has found that it wants or needs to
 *     install a certain element
 * -   when the application has been notified by an element (such as
 *     playbin or decodebin) that one or more plugins are missing *and* the
 *     application has decided that it wants to install one or more of
 *     those missing plugins
 *
 * The install functions in this section all take one or more 'detail
 * strings'. These detail strings contain information about the type of
 * plugin that needs to be installed (decoder, encoder, source, sink, or
 * named element), and some additional information such GStreamer version
 * used and a human-readable description of the component to install for
 * user dialogs.
 *
 * Applications should not concern themselves with the composition of the
 * string itself. They should regard the string as if it was a shared
 * secret between GStreamer and the plugin installer application.
 *
 * Detail strings can be obtained using the function
 * gst_missing_plugin_message_get_installer_detail() on a
 * missing-plugin message. Such a message will either have been found by
 * the application on a pipeline's #GstBus, or the application will have
 * created it itself using gst_missing_element_message_new(),
 * gst_missing_decoder_message_new(),
 * gst_missing_encoder_message_new(),
 * gst_missing_uri_sink_message_new(), or
 * gst_missing_uri_source_message_new().
 *
 * For each GStreamer element/plugin/component that should be installed,
 * the application needs one of those 'installer detail' string mentioned
 * in the previous section. This string can be obtained, as already
 * mentioned above, from a missing-plugin message using the function
 * gst_missing_plugin_message_get_installer_detail(). The
 * missing-plugin message is either posted by another element and then
 * found on the bus by the application, or the application has created it
 * itself as described above.
 *
 * The application will then call gst_install_plugins_async(), passing a
 * NULL-terminated array of installer detail strings, and a function that
 * should be called when the installation of the plugins has finished
 * (successfully or not). Optionally, a #GstInstallPluginsContext created
 * with gst_install_plugins_context_new() may be passed as well. This
 * way additional optional arguments like the application window's XID can
 * be passed to the external installer application.
 *
 * gst_install_plugins_async() will return almost immediately, with the
 * return code indicating whether plugin installation was started or not.
 * If the necessary hooks for plugin installation are in place and an
 * external installer application has in fact been called, the passed in
 * function will be called with a result code as soon as the external
 * installer has finished. If the result code indicates that new plugins
 * have been installed, the application will want to call
 * gst_update_registry() so the run-time plugin registry is updated and
 * the new plugins are made available to the application.
 *
 * > A Gtk/GLib main loop must be running in order for the result function
 * > to be called when the external installer has finished. If this is not
 * > the case, make sure to regularly call in your code:
 * >
 * > g_main_context_iteration (NULL,FALSE);
 *
 * ## 1. Installer hook
 *
 * When GStreamer applications initiate plugin installation via
 * gst_install_plugins_async() or gst_install_plugins_sync(), a
 * pre-defined helper application will be called.
 *
 * The exact path of the helper application to be called is set at compile
 * time, usually by the `./configure` script based on the install prefix.
 * For a normal package build into the `/usr` prefix, this will usually
 * default to `/usr/libexec/gst-install-plugins-helper` or
 * `/usr/lib/gst-install-plugins-helper`.
 *
 * Vendors/distros who want to support GStreamer plugin installation should
 * either provide such a helper script/application or use the `./configure`
 * option `--with-install-plugins-helper=/path/to/installer` to make
 * GStreamer call an installer of their own directly.
 *
 * It is strongly recommended that vendors provide a small helper
 * application as interlocutor to the real installer though, even more so
 * if command line argument munging is required to transform the command
 * line arguments passed by GStreamer to the helper application into
 * arguments that are understood by the real installer.
 *
 * The helper application path defined at compile time can be overriden at
 * runtime by setting the GST_INSTALL_PLUGINS_HELPER environment
 * variable. This can be useful for testing/debugging purposes.
 *
 * ## 2. Arguments passed to the install helper
 *
 * GStreamer will pass the following arguments to the install helper (this
 * is in addition to the path of the executable itself, which is by
 * convention argv[0]):
 *
 * -   none to many optional arguments in the form of `--foo-bar=val`.
 *     Example: `--transient-for=XID` where XID is the X Window ID of the
 *     main window of the calling application (so the installer can make
 *     itself transient to that window). Unknown optional arguments should
 *     be ignored by the installer.
 *
 * -   one 'installer detail string' argument for each plugin to be
 *     installed; these strings will have a `gstreamer` prefix; the exact
 *     format of the detail string is explained below
 *
 * ## 3. Detail string describing the missing plugin
 *
 * The string is in UTF-8 encoding and is made up of several fields,
 * separated by '|' characters (but neither the first nor the last
 * character is a '|'). The fields are:
 *
 * -   plugin system identifier, ie. "gstreamer"
 *     This identifier determines the format of the rest of the detail
 *     string. Automatic plugin installers should not process detail
 *     strings with unknown identifiers. This allows other plugin-based
 *     libraries to use the same mechanism for their automatic plugin
 *     installation needs, or for the format to be changed should it turn
 *     out to be insufficient.
 * -   plugin system version, e.g. "0.10"
 *     This is required so that when there is a GStreamer-0.12 or
 *     GStreamer-1.0 at some point in future, the different major versions
 *     can still co-exist and use the same plugin install mechanism in the
 *     same way.
 * -   application identifier, e.g. "totem"
 *     This may also be in the form of "pid/12345" if the program name
 *     can't be obtained for some reason.
 * -   human-readable localised description of the required component, e.g.
 *     "Vorbis audio decoder"
 * -   identifier string for the required component (see below for details
 *     about how to map this to the package/plugin that needs installing),
 *     e.g.
 *     -   urisource-$(PROTOCOL_REQUIRED), e.g. urisource-http or
 *         urisource-mms
 *     -   element-$(ELEMENT_REQUIRED), e.g. element-videoconvert
 *     -   decoder-$(CAPS_REQUIRED), e.g. (do read below for more
 *         details!):
 *         -   decoder-audio/x-vorbis
 *         -   decoder-application/ogg
 *         -   decoder-audio/mpeg, mpegversion=(int)4
 *         -   decoder-video/mpeg, systemstream=(boolean)true,
 *             mpegversion=(int)2
 *     -   encoder-$(CAPS_REQUIRED), e.g. encoder-audio/x-vorbis
 * -   optional further fields not yet specified
 *
 * An entire ID string might then look like this, for example: `
 * gstreamer|0.10|totem|Vorbis audio decoder|decoder-audio/x-vorbis`
 *
 * Plugin installers parsing this ID string should expect further fields
 * also separated by '|' symbols and either ignore them, warn the user, or
 * error out when encountering them.
 *
 * Those unfamiliar with the GStreamer 'caps' system should note a few
 * things about the caps string used in the above decoder/encoder case:
 *
 * -   the first part ("video/mpeg") of the caps string is a GStreamer
 *     media type and *not* a MIME type. Wherever possible, the GStreamer
 *     media type will be the same as the corresponding MIME type, but
 *     often it is not.
 * -   a caps string may or may not have additional comma-separated fields
 *     of various types (as seen in the examples above)
 * -   the caps string of a 'required' component (as above) will always
 *     have fields with fixed values, whereas an introspected string (see
 *     below) may have fields with non-fixed values. Compare for example:
 *     -   `audio/mpeg, mpegversion=(int)4` vs.
 *         `audio/mpeg, mpegversion=(int){2, 4}`
 *     -   `video/mpeg, mpegversion=(int)2` vs.
 *         `video/mpeg, systemstream=(boolean){ true, false}, mpegversion=(int)[1, 2]`
 *
 * ## 4. Exit codes the installer should return
 *
 * The installer should return one of the following exit codes when it
 * exits:
 *
 * -   0 if all of the requested plugins could be installed
 *     (#GST_INSTALL_PLUGINS_SUCCESS)
 * -   1 if no appropriate installation candidate for any of the requested
 *     plugins could be found. Only return this if nothing has been
 *     installed (#GST_INSTALL_PLUGINS_NOT_FOUND)
 * -   2 if an error occured during the installation. The application will
 *     assume that the user will already have seen an error message by the
 *     installer in this case and will usually not show another one
 *     (#GST_INSTALL_PLUGINS_ERROR)
 * -   3 if some of the requested plugins could be installed, but not all
 *     (#GST_INSTALL_PLUGINS_PARTIAL_SUCCESS)
 * -   4 if the user aborted the installation
 *     (#GST_INSTALL_PLUGINS_USER_ABORT)
 *
 * ## 5. How to map the required detail string to packages
 *
 * It is up to the vendor to find mechanism to map required components from
 * the detail string to the actual packages/plugins to install. This could
 * be a hardcoded list of mappings, for example, or be part of the
 * packaging system metadata.
 *
 * GStreamer plugin files can be introspected for this information. The
 * `gst-inspect` utility has a special command line option that will output
 * information similar to what is required. For example `
 * $ gst-inspect-1.0 --print-plugin-auto-install-info /path/to/libgstvorbis.so
 * should output something along the lines of
 * `decoder-audio/x-vorbis`, `element-vorbisdec` `element-vorbisenc`
 * `element-vorbisparse`, `element-vorbistag`, `encoder-audio/x-vorbis`
 *
 * Note that in the encoder and decoder case the introspected caps can be
 * more complex with additional fields, e.g.
 * `audio/mpeg,mpegversion=(int){2,4}`, so they will not always exactly
 * match the caps wanted by the application. It is up to the installer to
 * deal with this (either by doing proper caps intersection using the
 * GStreamer #GstCaps API, or by only taking into account the media type).
 *
 * Another potential source of problems are plugins such as ladspa or
 * libvisual where the list of elements depends on the installed
 * ladspa/libvisual plugins at the time. This is also up to the
 * distribution to handle (but usually not relevant for playback
 * applications).
