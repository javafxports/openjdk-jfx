/**
 * SECTION:gstversion
 * @short_description: GStreamer version macros.
 *
 * Use the GST_VERSION_* macros e.g. when defining own plugins. The GStreamer
 * runtime checks if these plugin and core version match and refuses to use a
 * plugin compiled against a different version of GStreamer.
 * You can also use the macros to keep the GStreamer version information in
 * your application.
 *
 * Use the gst_version() function if you want to know which version of
 * GStreamer you are currently linked against.
 *
 * The version macros get defined by including "gst/gst.h".
