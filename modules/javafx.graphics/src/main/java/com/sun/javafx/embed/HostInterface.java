     * Grabs focus on this window.
     *
     * All mouse clicks that occur in this window's client area or client-areas
     * of any of its unfocusable owned windows are delivered as usual. Whenever
     * a click occurs on another app's window (not related via the ownership
     * relation with this one, or a focusable owned window), or on non-client
     * area of any window (titlebar, etc.), or any third-party app's window, or
     * native OS GUI (e.g. a taskbar), the grab is automatically reset, and the
     * window that held the grab receives the FOCUS_UNGRAB event.
     *
     * Note that for this functionality to work correctly, the window must have
     * a focus upon calling this method. All owned popup windows that should be
     * operable during the grabbed focus state (e.g. nested popup menus) must
     * be unfocusable (see {@link #setFocusable}). Clicking a focusable owned
     * window will reset the grab due to a focus transfer.
     *
     * The click that occurs in another window and causes resetting of the grab
     * may or may not be delivered to that other window depending on the native
     * OS behavior.
     *
     * If any of the application's windows already holds the grab, it is reset
     * prior to grabbing the focus for this window. The method may be called
     * multiple times for one window. Subsequent calls do not affect the grab
     * status unless it is reset between the calls, in which case the focus
     * is grabbed again.
     *
     * Note that grabbing the focus on an application window may prevent
     * delivering certain events to other applications until the grab is reset.
     * Therefore, if the application has finished showing popup windows based
     * on a user action (e.g. clicking a menu item), and doesn't require the
     * grab any more, it should call the {@link #ungrabFocus} method. The
     * FOCUS_UNGRAB event signals that the grab has been reset.
     *
     * A user event handler associated with a menu item must be invoked after
     * resetting the grab. Otherwise, if a developer debugs the application and
     * has installed a breakpoint in the event handler, the debugger may become
     * unoperable due to events blocking for other applications on some
     * platforms.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if the operation is successful
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the window isn't focused currently
