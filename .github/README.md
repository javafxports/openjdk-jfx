[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/javafxports/openjdk-jfx.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/javafxports/openjdk-jfx) [![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/javafxports/openjdk-jfx?branch=develop&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/javafxports-github-bot/openjdk-jfx)

This repository is a GIT mirror of the official HG [openjfx/jfx-dev/rt](https://hg.openjdk.java.net/openjfx/jfx-dev/rt) repo on OpenJDK.

OpenJFX is an open source, next generation client application platform for desktop, mobile and embedded systems based on JavaSE. It is a collaborative effort by many individuals and companies with the goal of producing a modern, efficient, and fully featured toolkit for developing rich client applications. This is the open source project where we develop JavaFX.

OpenJFX is free software, licensed under the [GPL with the class path exception](../LICENSE), just as OpenJDK. Anybody is welcome to contribute to this project, port it to other platforms or devices, or do anything else that a free software license allows you to do! We welcome patches and involvement from individual contributors or companies. See Community for details on how we work and how you can become a contributor.

OpenJFX is a project beneath the charter of the OpenJDK. The [OpenJDK Bylaws](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws) and [License](../LICENSE) govern our work. The OpenJFX project membership can be found on the [OpenJDK Census](http://openjdk.java.net/census#openjfx).
